I was trying to get a more customizable notifications system setup for my 3d printer running klipper firmware to my discord channel. This is what I came up with, figured someone else might find it useful as well.

Download the script, change the variables at the top for your desired use, then run with python3 klipperdiscordnotifications.py, preferrably on the raspberry pi you have connected to the 3d printer running klipper, but not neccessary to be on host machine
just make sure to change the hostip from 127.0.0.1 to your own.

Enjoy!
